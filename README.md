Cyber Lab is an educational platform designed to teach users about cybersecurity concepts, vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking techniques in a controlled, authorized environment. Our goal is to empower users to understand how systems can be breached and, more importantly, how to secure them against such threats. This project provides hands-on labs with Python scripts and detailed tutorials to explore tools like packet sniffers, keyloggers, and brute-force password crackers.

**Disclaimer**: Cyber Lab is strictly for educational purposes. We are not responsible for any illegal activities conducted by users. All tools and techniques should only be used with explicit permission in a controlled environment.
